# Forge Mods Created by NevioGames

Welcome to the official repository for my Forge mods! This project includes a list of all mods I have created and currently maintain. Each mod brings unique features and gameplay elements to Minecraft, enhancing the game in various ways. Below, you will find descriptions and details for each mod in this collection.

## Included Mods

### 1. LBAHExtended *1
**LBAHExtended** enhances the **LBAH Minecraft Server** experience by introducing a range of unique blocks and features tailored specifically to enhance the feeling of the **LBAH World** by **dagilp_lbh**. This mod provides new building blocks and special decorative elements that add depth and customization options to that world, making it more immersive and engaging for players. The goal of **LBAHExtended** is to bring additional creativity and functionality that seamlessly integrate with the LBAH aesthetic.

### 2. Harry Potter Univers
**Harry Potter Universe** brings the magic of the Wizarding World to Minecraft. Experience the thrills of spells, and magical creatures inspired by the Harry Potter series. From Hogwarts to magical items, this mod adds a new layer of adventure for all fans of the series. (The Original Mod was created by **snidget** but i dont have an link to the Old Downloads) 
**Note**: This mod **requires [GeckoLib](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/geckolib)** to function properly. Please ensure GeckoLib is installed alongside this mod to enable animations and other essential features.

### 3. Plant Mega Pack
**Plant Mega Pack** is a reimagining and expansion of the original **Plant Mega Pack** created by **10paktimbits**. This mod enriches Minecraft with an extensive variety of flora, from bushes to flowers and vines. Perfect for those who love nature, this pack allows you to create lush, vibrant landscapes that bring your Minecraft world to life.

### 4. ModControl
**ModControl** provides a simple but essential feature: it sends a list of installed mods from the client to the server. This list contains only the names of the installed mods, making it easy for server administrators to verify mod that those mods are allowed.

### 5. Big Chat History
**Big Chat History** expands the in-game chat history, making it easier to scroll back and review conversations. No more losing important messages! This mod is especially useful for players who frequently play on multiplayer servers or enjoy large community discussions.
